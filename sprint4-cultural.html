        Understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity benefits people because it allows people to understand the ability of their own mind to change and is a key factor in people being able to understand and plan around their own mental habits to best achieve their goals.
I think you can engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit by recognizing the best ways to achieve structural change to brain and to plan your behaviors in such a way to maximize the potential growth.
Some ways you can increase your Neuroplasticity is by getting enough sleep, and making sure you have a good diet and exercise as these things affect the chemical part of brain change. Reducing stress and staying calm also increases neuroplasticity and reading and brain games are good too. It actually kind of reminds me of a lot of professional gamers who play brain games while they are waiting for their actual game to start as it improves their performance.
A resource I found particularly interesting regarding neuroplasticity was the TEDx talk done by Lara Boyd on Neuroplasticity as it includes some very interesting examples, including how people who read braille have larger hand sensory areas in their brain than those of us that don’t and how London taxi cab drivers who have to memories a map of London have a larger special and mapping part of their brain.

A growth mindset is essentially being open to learning experiences and understanding that we are all works in progress and understanding that there is always the potential to improve, and that life is a constant journey of learning. The opposite of the growth mindset is that static mindset, where one assumes that their character, intelligence and creative ability are fixed and never change. It’s relevant because it defines the way that we engage with new material and push ourselves to achieve further goals. It’s relevant because I think in life there are far too many people that use their limitations to define themselves, whilst not understanding that character, intelligence and creative ability are things that you have to work on as well.
I think in exploration the thing that surprised me was the difference between the false growth outlook and the growth outlook because I’ve never heard it described that way but it makes sense i.e. just because you have a positive outlook does not mean you have a growth one.
I think I’ve got a pretty good growth mindset already, as I have always felt that there are way too many people out there that don’t engage with things because they think they aren’t capable, where I already understand that if I work at something you can always surprise yourself by overcoming your perceived limitations.
A resource I found interesting on the growth mindset is this article in the Harvard Business Review by Carol Dweck on the subject.

I think that understanding neuroplasticity and the growth mindset will shape and influence my learning plan by providing reasoning behind the regular exercise and managing of lifestyle as these things are key factors in improving neuroplasticity. Having a growth mindset will influence my learning plan by making me push myself in areas I feel like I struggle as there is more room for potential growth. I also think that both of these concepts are fairly familiar to me, and I can notice parts of them within my everyday life,  so part of me was probably thinking about these when forming my learning plan.

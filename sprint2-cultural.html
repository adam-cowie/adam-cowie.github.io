    My long term goal or career pathway is to be able to use my programming skills to increase connectivity between the financial and agricultural sectors. In my time working in agri-accounting I got a first hand view of the challenges faces the agricultural industry in this area and want to be able to use my knowledge of accounting and agricultural in a productive way.

    I think my biggest strengths in bootcamp will be my ability to understand and get on with new people and work in groups , as growing up in a hostel made me very aware from a young age how essential being able to work with others is in running things successfully. I think some of my limitations in bootcamp will probably just be some initial awkwardness around meeting new people and perhaps presenting things in front of people as I haven’t done that in a while.  
    </br>
My biggest non-technical challenge in bootcamp will initially be balancing my lifestyle as I move to a new city and start work on something new. Even once I get over the initial moving shakeup the thing I need to remind myself about is regular exercise and keeping a normal diet as you study, as other times I’ve studied these have been things that I’ve struggled with and these things work away at your motivation in the long run.
    </br>
I think the skills I would like to see developed probably relate to my limitations I was talking about above in that I would probably like to make sure that presenting in front of people skills are up to scratch. I also think that I would like to develop my reflective skills even further while at bootcamp and also I always felt socially awkward in professional situations but I think bootcamp in itself will be good for working on that.
    </br>
My expectations from the bootcamp team is mostly just that they can point me in the right direction if I’m lost for what to do next, and also let me know if I’m well outside the scope of what I’m trying to do. I think in my mind, due to the self-directed nature of the learning my expectations are more in line with peers who have been and done it before and know where to point you as opposed to a more traditional teacher role, I guess.
</br>
I think during bootcamp, I just need to recognize where you are sort of “going down a rabbit hole” in looking for a solution when there’s something I’m obviously missing. I think in these situations asking a peer I’m working with or someone close by is probably a decent first option, followed by asking the bootcamp facilitator. I think managing my workload in this program will essentially come down to managing a couple other things in my life, such as getting exercise early in the day so that I’m able to more productively work and set aside time later for further study. If I do that then I think that will enable me to work more productively and safely with other learners and facilitators as I feel like generally do well working with others anyway.

        My long-term goal is to be able to contribute to or create something innovate within the sphere of agriculture and technology.</br>
            In terms of what skills, I would like to see developed whilst at EDA would probably be collaborative work skills, as though I’ve worked in teams before this has mostly been a research and present format rather than seamless collaborative work.</br>
            My strengths include a natural inquisitiveness and a sense of genuine inquiry that helps to pull me through most of what I’m learning, an understanding of how to get along with and work with others, and familiarity with working with numbers. I think as far as limitations go; I think there are stages where I need to re-focus back to the original task as I easily get caught up on tangents so it’s important for me that I remember what the desired learning outcomes are and remember to roughly stick to them.</br>
            I will manage the workload of the program by setting myself achievable targets each day and working to get them done. I think that the self-learning nature of the course means that it is also probably important to leave yourself time to explore and spend time with something new that you find interesting so I think it will be important to work this in with any targets. I think also getting into good habits around tracking time is essential as it will allow me to more accurately gauge whether I’m using my time efficiently and once you are in the habit of doing it, it will become like second nature. I also think that part of managing the workload is managing your lifestyle as well, because the nature of this learning involves a lot of screen time it’s important to make sure you to exercise etc otherwise the work will wear you down over time.
        </br>If I require help with a problem, I would say the first port of call would be any peers I’m working but failing that I see slack as the best place to ask someone about a problem, I think there would be a couple of boards where someone would help and failing that I could message my facilitator.
    </br> As far as what I expect from the facilitation team, the self-learning nature of the course probably means that what I’ll need is perhaps just guidance when I get a little bit off course and perhaps just the odd suggestion on how to expand my learning.

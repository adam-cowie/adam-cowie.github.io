        I think one thing I learned about myself and my ego as a result of my core learning is probably the extent to which my ego affects all my decisions and is constantly on my mind whereas that is something I used to be somewhat ignorant of. I think I also learned how important utilising emotional intelligence already was is my life but that I could utilize it better as well. I also learned a lot about myself during the identities and values exploration as that wasn’t a exercise that I had done before and it made me think more about the impact past events have had on created who I am as a person.

        The roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming a critical as they are the things that determine how well we can work together with others. These things are important not only in programming but in all industries, however I think that perhaps there is a special emphasis on them within programming as it tends to require a high level of teamwork as it involves working incredibly closely with others. I also think in industries where you are working to develop a product or something new also require a little bit more thought about the values involved as understanding the differing values within you team is key to making sure that everyone is pulling in the same direction in terms of vision.

        The most challenging aspects of the core learning was I suppose getting into the habit of actively reflecting and meditating. This is because at the start it always feels like something that slows you down as my learning always tending to be like a rouge train, speeding away getting as far as possible until it crashes and I need to take a break for a while. I found during the course of working on the core learning however that I found that I was able to commit to working for longer because the regular breaks and reflecting helped me to balance the study more and work more productively at the same time.

        I think you spend so much time focusing on core learning as a programming school because one of the key factors in being successful as a programmer beyond any technical skills is being able more actively manage yourself and the way you work with others, as well as always trying to get a better understanding of the world so you can work within it. I think a lot of the professional qualifications that involve programming focus entirely on technical skills and so even though their graduates are technically sound, they still have to spend time learning how to work together with people when entering the work place.
</br>
        I don’t think the core learning has been a waste of time because it has fed into my programming learning, as well as providing something different to do and opportunity to reflect when you’ve been working on something technical for a while. I think there are clear benefits to working on stuff like that as opposed to just practising programming instead, because it helps you with your learning so that the technical things that you are trying to learn will be easier too. Plus, as well as learning JavaScript, the object of this course is to teach you how to learn a programming language, so addressing the way we learn in a bit of detail makes sense.

            I would describe my core personal values as honesty, compassion, community curiosity, loyalty. Over the course of my life I would say these have changed in importance to me, but I would say out of those values I would choose community as the defining value, as it incorporates so much of the other values and is almost unstoppable when used in the right way.
    </br>As much as I can think, I can never think of a situation where I’ve had a large ethical quandary, though I think there are several situations I could point to where I demonstrated some of my individual values. There was one situation where I was working at New World when I was younger and someone had left $100 cash in the Apples (SN: I used to work in produce as a teenager and people used to almost daily walk in and drop things in the fruit) and I handed it in as opposed to take it even though no-one saw me take and I doubt whom-ever dropped it came back for it. I suppose that would be an example of a situation where I showed honesty even though there was no benefit for me doing so. I think there are a number of examples with my friends where I have shown some of my personal values as there have been a number of situations where friends have come to me for advice or needed help and I would say these would probably be where compassion and loyalty are really important.
            <br>I think my culture is probably somewhat defined by my growing up in a rural community and experiencing the change that comes with shifting to a city at a young age. This is especially true of the respect I have for the value of community, as growing up in rural communities, you understand the power that people have when they all strive towards common goals and also how easily this can start to break down when people don’t act in good faith. This also fed into a lot of the other values I respect as most of these are necessary things to successfully make a community thrive. This was especially clear to me when I went to boarding school, as I was thrust into another sort of community, albeit very different, but no less dependent on those common things to help it function properly.

        Emotional intelligence is the ability to actively think about your own and other people’s emotions, to be able to view them clearly enough that you can think logically about and to recognise your own thinking patterns so that you can form habits that help you work more efficiently. The activities involved in utilising and improving your emotional intelligence are attention training, self-knowledge & self-mastery, and then creating useful mental habits.
    </br>    It’s different from IQ in that EQ relies a lot on being able to understand and recognise emotions, which isn’t something that necessarily comes with a high IQ. Also, I’m not sure of what the fluidity of an IQ is like though I know that it does change during one’s lifetime, whereas emotional intelligence is something that is more easily taught as it involves skills that everyone can be taught and is the full extension of reflecting properly on things, which everyone does in one form or another. 
    </br>It’s important because it affects the way and success with which we interact with the world, and it also helps you build more beneficial mental habits so that you can work more effectively towards your goals. A lot of the most successful people in society have built their success off creating useful mental habits and using them to more effectively work towards their goals. Generally, it helps with social connectivity too as it allows it allows you to understand your own emotions better, and by extension it helps you to understand others emotions and how everything fits together too.

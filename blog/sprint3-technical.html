        A good analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS would be say if you were looking at a house, the html would be the physical wall that you were seeing and the CSS would be the like things that define the positioning of the wall and how it looks like background framing. Perhaps a better analogy would be 
    </br>A loop is a way of setting something to repeat any number times. It would be like if you were managing a sports team, and when your setting up the drill with a number of actions, and the loop would be the way you would tell you team to repeat that drill a number of times. There are a couple of ways to set a loop to run, like commands such as For, While and 
</br>The DOM or Document Object Model is an interface that can be used to interact with all the components that make up a website. When you show the entire structure of it, looks like the root system on a tree, with each root extending down and splitting containing different components dictating all the things that happen on the website. Since each part of the website essentially boil down to different sections of code there is a lot of power in being able to use the DOM, and being able to use the DOM will allow you to manipulate a lot of the different components without having to manually build the components each time.
</br>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects is that when you are accessing data from an array you use indexes and when you access data from a object, you use the defined properties. If you were to visualise an array, it would be as if someone had laid a range of snacks out in front of you in a line, and how you access it would be like saying the snack that I want is the second snack from the start or the third snack from the end. In other words, when you access data from an array, you use a system that works on starting at either side and then providing a integer to determine which data is accessed (By changing between a positive and negative integer you can change whether you access the data from the left or the right). By contrast, an object stores all the data under specific properties, so this would be like if your friend laid all the snacks out in front of you again but this time hid what they were under labels. To access the data or choose which snack you would like you choose the property that you were looking for i.e. chips to get the snack underneath. In other words, you can use specify which property you are looking for in each object, and donâ€™t have to worry about the order the data is in. 
</br>Functions are essentially just a re-usable piece of code. When your coding you can use a function to define a part of code that you might want to use a number of times or in a number of different places in the code. A real world analogy for a function would be say if you were baking cookies and made a couple of different stencils to cut the cookies, where the stencils are the functions as you can use them a number of times to do the same thing

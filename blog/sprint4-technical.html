        I had a problem with the Fizzbuzz challenge as I didn’t think about using the modulus operator as a way of finding out if something is perfectly divisible by setting it to 0. When I encountered this problem, I first re-read the intrsuctions of what I was doing, I used the rubber ducky method by talking through the problem as I saw it, and in the end I googled and figured out that I could use the modulus operator that way. I actually re-enforced my learning of all the different operators you can use in JavaScript as the website I found the solution on had info on all of them too.

        Another problem I was having was in the Manipulating JS Objects challenge I was struggling to define one of the properties as an object. In that situation I again, re-read the instructions, but this time I looked at the code I had written earlier that had passed the first part of the test and decided to re-write the code to see if it would work If I combined a number of lines, which it did so I feel like that was an elegant way to solve a problem in that, by trying to re-write it differently, I had made it work. I think in that process I learnt that by trying to re-create what you have already written a different way is a useful way of trouble shooting too.

        I think I am fairly confident on the problem-solving technique and process as a number of these techniques are fleshed out versions of what we do naturally and the others follow a logical process so are easy to follow.
</br>
        I feel like using pseudocode correctly is a handy way of ensuring problems don’t occur in the first place as it allows you to more accurately plan the purpose of your code, and also means that if you require help from someone and they have to look over the code they can see the purpose of what your trying to do without you having to explain every step.
</br>
        The rubber duck method is essentially just using something as a sounding board for your trouble shooting ideas. The actual method describes doing this with a physical duck but almost anything on your desk works and other people work just as fine as well. This is a fairly common method of problem solving across different industries.
</br>
        Console logging involves using the console to show you the contents on different variables and parts of your code, so you can more accurately figure out which part of the code is throwing the error. This is a fairly handy technique to use as it allows you to more quickly figure out if specific variables are wrong.
        I think something I noticed about working with some older people especially, is just how different our generations use of google is. I feel like because we grew up around computers more we are very comfortable googling all of our problems and the amount of times someone would come and ask me about a computer problem and I would think, you could have just googled that and it would have been faster than you walking over here, so I would say I am very comfortable using google. Once you know the specific way to structure queries in google to get results you can use it fast and efficiently too 
</br>
        Being able to go to coaches and peers for help is important too, not only because it allows you to employ the rubber ducky method but also because generally there are no issues that you can run into that someone hasn’t encountered themselves before, and as such people working with you are likely to have valuable advice on your issue, or if not, they might now better where to look. A lot of the time when I encountered issues in accounting, my coach or peer would be able to point me to a resource that would improve my understanding as opposed to just telling you what the answer is or fixing it for you.
</br>
        I think I’m pretty confident with reflecting to bolster my understanding of my own problem solving. It forms an integral part of the mindfulness and emotional intelligence stuff we worked on during the second week. It allows you to engage in your problem solving for longer and be more thorough with it.

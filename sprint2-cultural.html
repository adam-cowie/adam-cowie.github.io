            My long-term goal is to be able to contribute to or create something innovate within the sphere of agriculture and technology.</br>
            In terms of what skills, I would like to see developed whilst at EDA would probably be collaborative work skills, as though I’ve worked in teams before this has mostly been a research and present format rather than seamless collaborative work.</br>
            My strengths include a natural inquisitiveness and a sense of genuine inquiry that helps to pull me through most of what I’m learning, an understanding of how to get along with and work with others, and familiarity with working with numbers. I think as far as limitations go; I think there are stages where I need to re-focus back to the original task as I easily get caught up on tangents so it’s important for me that I remember what the desired learning outcomes are and remember to roughly stick to them.</br>
            I will manage the workload of the program by setting myself achievable targets each day and working to get them done. I think that the self-learning nature of the course means that it is also probably important to leave yourself time to explore and spend time with something new that you find interesting so I think it will be important to work this in with any targets. I think also getting into good habits around tracking time is essential as it will allow me to more accurately gauge whether I’m using my time efficiently and once you are in the habit of doing it, it will become like second nature. I also think that part of managing the workload is managing your lifestyle as well, because the nature of this learning involves a lot of screen time it’s important to make sure you to exercise etc otherwise the work will wear you down over time.
        </br>If I require help with a problem, I would say the first port of call would be any peers I’m working but failing that I see slack as the best place to ask someone about a problem, I think there would be a couple of boards where someone would help and failing that I could message my facilitator.
    </br> As far as what I expect from the facilitation team, the self-learning nature of the course probably means that what I’ll need is perhaps just guidance when I get a little bit off course and perhaps just the odd suggestion on how to expand my learning.
